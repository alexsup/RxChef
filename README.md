# RxChef

In this tutorial we will be learning the concepts of ReactiveX and Reactive Programming whilst running the kitchen for a hugely successful vintage 1950s diner. By the end you'll be a fully fledged RxChef.

## What is Reactive Programming ?

Reactive programming is an increasingly popular style of programming to compose your application
using streams of events. Sound technical? Well lets break it down.

There are two core components Observables and Subscribers.

An Observable is something that can be reacted to (Hence why we call it reactive programming); this could be an event or a property. Some examples of observables in the kitchen could be:

- Getting a new order.
- How many buns are there left for the burgers?
